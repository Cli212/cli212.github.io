Hi! I am a third-year PhD student in the [Autonomous Vision Group (AVG)](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/autonomous-vision/home/) supervised by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://www.cvlibs.net/) at Univeristy of Tübingen and Tübingen AI Center.

My research interests are generally driven by my research vision - to build computationally efficient intelligent agents that liberate human labor. Currently, I am doing research on diffusion language models motivated by my reflections on current LLMs: (1) the redundant long reasoning process of current LLMs could be caused by the noise accumulation of autoregressive generation, (2) memory-bound Diffusion LMs have the potential to be much faster on inference than compute-bound autoregressive models given sufficient GPUs. Therefore, let's make diffusion language models great! 

Besides, I am also interested in shifting the paradigm under the 'linearization assumption (everything in the inputs is flattened)' to models that can use ubiquitous hierarchies effectively. For example, concept models, hierarchical models...

My life is somehow sports-centric. I am a crazy enthusiast in cycling 🚴🚵. I play tennis 🎾 and ski ⛷️ as well. 

My CV is [here](./assets/pdf/Haoyu_CV_Research.pdf)
